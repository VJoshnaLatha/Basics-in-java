Area Calculation
Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes. 
Input format: 
First input: a side of a square in integer 
Second input: length of a rectangle in integer 
Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer 
Fourth input: radius of a circle in float 
Output format: 
The first output should be the area of a square in integer 
The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer 
The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places
Sample Input:
