Is N divisible by X and Y?
Given a number N. Given two numbers X and Y, the task is to find the sum of all those numbers from 1 to N that are divisible by X or by Y.
Approach: To solve the problem, follow the below steps:
->Find the sum of numbers that are divisible by X upto N. Denote it by S1. 
->Find the sum of numbers that are divisible by Y upto N. Denote it by S2. 
->Find the sum of numbers that are divisible by both X and Y upto N. Denote it by S3. 
->The final answer will be S1 + S2 â€“ S3.
For S1: The total numbers that will be divisible by X upto N will be N/X and the sum will be: 
S1 = ((N/X)/2) * (2 * X + (N/X - 1) * X)
For S2: The total numbers that will be divisible by Y upto N will be N/Y and the sum will be: 
S2 = ((N/Y)/2) * (2 * Y + (N/Y - 1) * Y)
For S3: The total numbers that will be divisible by both X and Y upto N will be N/lcm(X, Y) and the sum will be: 
S2 = ((N/lcm(X, Y))/2) * ((2 * lcm(X,Y)) + (N/lcm(X,Y) - 1) * lcm(X,Y))/2
Therefore, the result will be: 
S = S1 + S2 - S3
