Alice in Wonderland
Alice was bored that day, so she was sitting on the riverbank. Suddenly she notices a talking, White Rabbit with a pocket watch. It ran fast, and she followed it, down a rabbit hole. She fell into the hole and found a magical wonderland with dark trees and beautiful flowers. She found many ways numbered from 1,2,3,...â€¦..18.she was confused about which is the right way that will lead her to her home. She found a cute bird, standing in one of the trees. Alice asked the bird the way to go back to her home. The bird said a two-digit number( say 23 ) and asked her to find the sum of its digits (2+3=5) and that numbered way will lead her to her home. Alice was already confused, so pls help Alice in finding the route to her home...
